In Calculus, the power rule is a fundamental result stating that the derivative of a power
function is given by the product of the exponent and the base raised to the power of the exponent minus one.
Typically, the power rule is proven using the limit definition of the derivative alongside the Binomial theorem.
In this manuscript, we present an alternative approach to proving the power rule, utilizing a specific polynomial
identity that captures the function's growth.
This method omits the direct use of the Binomial theorem, offering a distinct way to the same result.
